This folder contains a collection of small, self‑contained Python utilities I use for automation, system monitoring, and terminal integrations.
Each tool is built around the same principles: simplicity, portability, and macOS/Linux compatibility.
These scripts can be used individually or combined through cron jobs, workflows, or other automation tools.
